(** The simulation game's response choice, and the product it generates.

    This is the decision the proof solver makes at every step: given that the
    left-hand FSM has moved [from --label-> _], which state must the
    right-hand FSM move to? It used to live inside
    {!Mebi_plugin.Proof_solver_step}, tangled with the {b Rocq} goal it was
    read out of, which meant it could only ever be run one proof step at a
    time and could not be tested without a Rocq runtime.

    It is pure model code, so it lives here. {i See [ASSISTED-CHANGES.md],
    2026-09-29: an offline re-implementation of {!S.respond} that mirrored
    the original rather than sharing it got the right pairs but the wrong
    response in 8 of 16 cases, because the tie-breaks run through the
    ordering of actions ([Action.compare]). Everything that needs this
    decision must call this function, never reproduce it.} *)
